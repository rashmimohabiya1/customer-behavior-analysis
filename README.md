# customer-behavior-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior to uncover insights that can improve business decision-making, retention strategies, and sales performance. It involves loading a dataset in Python, cleaning and analyzing data, running SQL queries on MySQL, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key findings.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographic and transaction details, including purchase dates, product categories, and spending patterns. The data was preprocessed and stored in a MySQL database for analysis.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

MySQL: Data storage, querying, and transformation

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization

Gamma App (optional): Presentation and report creation

Steps

Data Loading: Imported the dataset into Python for initial exploration.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized column formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends in purchase behavior and customer segments.

SQL Queries: Executed SQL queries on MySQL to filter, group, and aggregate customer data.

Dashboard Development: Created a Power BI dashboard highlighting key metrics like CLV, churn rate, and purchase frequency.

Reporting: Summarized findings into a visual report using Power BI and Gamma.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard presents insights such as:

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Average Order Value (AOV)

Purchase Frequency

Churn Rate

Top Performing Customer Segments

Results

Identified high-value customers contributing significantly to overall revenue.

Uncovered seasonal and category-based purchase trends.

Derived insights to improve retention and personalized marketing strategies.
